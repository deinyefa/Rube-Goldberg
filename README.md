It took a little over 2 weeks to complete this project. I liked how challenging it was and I saw in practice how concepts like objects and classes work. It also allowed me to be creative in how I tackled the requirements. One major challenge I faced while working on this project was preventing the player from throwing the ball from outside the platform. I thought to use layers and raycasting, but it only worked some of the time, so I ended up making it so the the player cannot teleport while holding the ball. This is because the platform is big enough that the player would need to teleport to leave it.

Note: I deleted the OVR plugin to create space
